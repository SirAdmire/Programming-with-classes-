// --- EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS: CREATIVE ENHANCEMENTS ---
// This program goes beyond the core requirements by including the following features:
// 1. A Library of Scriptures: Instead of a single scripture, the program maintains a
//    library of several scriptures, from which it selects one at random for each
//    memorization session.
// 2. Intelligent Word Hiding: The 'Scripture.HideWords()' method is designed to
//    intelligently select and hide only words that are not already hidden. This
//    provides a more effective and logical memorization flow.
// 3. Continuous Practice: When a scripture is fully hidden, the program offers the
//    user the option to start a new session with a new, random scripture, promoting
//    extended practice without needing to restart the application.
